Text: 

Hi there. I'm **Jon Aizlewood**, a visual designer with over 10 years of experience in the digital space. I specialise in user interface design and front-end development, where I work closely with clients to help bring their digital product's visual language to life.  

Over the course of my design career I've had the pleasure of working with the likes of <strong>NBC Universal</strong>, <strong>UNICEF UK</strong>, <strong>Penguin Random House</strong>, <strong>Code for America</strong>, the <strong>BBC</strong>, <strong>Nordea</strong>, <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong> and the <strong>British Medical Journal</strong> â€” to name a few.  I currently ply my trade at award-winning UX design agency <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a>.

Prior to dedicating my career to digital design, I led a life as a management-level digital marketer.  It's no coincidence that I moved over to design after seeing so many products and ideas fail due to poor design and usb-par user experiences.

Away from work I currently reside in Brighton, where I live with my amazingly talented wife and my two wonderful daughters near the seaside.

This site is powered by the excellent [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com).  

It was developed using [Mark Perkins'](http://twitter.com/allmarkedup) 'Elf' development environment, using Sass, Grunt and coded in Sublime.  All images have been optimised using JPEGMini or ImageOptim.

The early design explorations were done using the wonderful [Sketch app](http://sketchapp.com), and the site is typeset with (gasp!) **three** fonts: Playfair Display, Oswald and ~~Quattrocento Sans~~ Source Sans Pro, all found on the [Google Webfonts](http://google.com/fonts) platform.
