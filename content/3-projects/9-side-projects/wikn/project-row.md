**wikn** is an unbaked idea for a site catered to the newcomers in the web industry.  

There's always an expectation that everyone knows what they're doing in life.  The reality is that no one has a clue, and they're just winging it. 

Wikn (*What I know now*) is a side project intended to help newbies gain knowledge and insight from anonymous advice given by 'veterans'.  The intention was/is to manually accept and publish anonymous posts, in turn creating a valuable resource of information that might help old and young alike.
