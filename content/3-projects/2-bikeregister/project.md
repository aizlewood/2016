##The Challenge

BikeRegister came to Clearleft looking to redesign their existing site while refining and optimising their registration flow. They also wanted a pattern library of code and assets that they could re-use and build upon in the future.  The project required a quick delivery and direct liaising with their internal development team in order to launch the new site - complete with new branding as echoed in their forthcoming product packaging - as soon as possible.
