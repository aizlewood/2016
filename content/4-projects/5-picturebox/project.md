lede:  PictureBox is a video on demand film service offering a selection of films for a monthly subscription. It launched in 2006 and is available online or as a separate subscription through several Digital TV service providers in selected countries such as United Kingdom, Poland, Russia and Central and Latin America (Mexico, Colombia and Brazil). PictureBox is the only wholly owned SVOD (subscription video on demand service) operated by NBCUniversal.

Following several successful projects with NBC Universal, Clearleft were asked to help reinvigorate PictureBox.

### The Challenges 

Unfortunately the original PictureBox design was tired and lacked differentiation amongst its competitors. The key USPs of the product were muddy, and the route to sign-up was complex and convoluted. Ultimately, the service was in need of a full tactical refresh versus the optimisation of a single sign-up journey. 

### Rebranding through the interface
Although Clearleft were never commissioned to rebrand the PictureBox service, early visual design explorations highlighted the disparity between the old brand language and the new - a striking colour palette coupled with unique angular cuts and big, bold typography.  

Coupled with successful co-design workshops and extensive competitive analysis as well as an interactive prototype that addressed and simplified the various sign-up routes, we designed a fully-responsive design system that allowed users to shortlist and view movies on a wide range of connected devices. 

Our deliverables to PictureBox's incumbent agency included our tried-and-tested pattern portfolio and a comprehensive style guidelines designed to ensure consistency during implementation led the NBC team to use the new visual language and direction as the basis for PictureBox's presence across all media including print, apps and interactive TV.
